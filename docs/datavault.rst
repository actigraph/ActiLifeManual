Data Vault Tab
==============

--------------

The Data Vault tool is a secure, cloud-based storage system integrated
into the ActiLife program that allows users to quickly and securely save
files into their own personal cloud to share with others. There are many
immediate benefits to the Data Vault system including:

-  Simplified Data Sharing
-  Reduced IT costs
-  Built-in data backup and retention
-  Fast storage

ADDING FILES TO THE DATA VAULT
------------------------------

ActiLife 6 users receive 4GB of free space. To add files to the Data
Vault, navigate to the Data Vault tab and click the “Add File(s)”
button. Browse to the file location and select the files you wish to
upload. Multiple files may be added by holding the “Shift” key on the
keyboard while selecting files. Click “Open” to start the upload
process.   ### SUB FOLDERS ###

Sub folder organization in the Data Vault is available in ActiLife
version 6.0 and later. To add sub-folders, click the “New Folder” button
in the Data Vault view. Users who are sharing license groups between
ActiLife 5 and ActiLife 6 should be aware that ActiLife 5 users can only
upload to the root directory and cannot see or utilize any subfolders
that were created by ActiLife 6 users.

SHARING DATA WITH COLLEAGUES – LICENSE GROUPING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

License grouping allows dispersed Data Vault users to share their
valuable data quickly and easily. ActiLife Full and Lite licenses are
automatically grouped together. A Lite user who uploads files using
their Data Vault tab will automatically see any files that a Full user
uploads, and vice versa. This ensures centralization of important
actigraphy data when that data is being collected across multiple study
sites.

Institutions and Universities can also be grouped together under a
single License Group for collaboration on studies. For information on
License Grouping, contact ActiGraph support at support@theactigraph.com

MULTIPART UPLOADS
-----------------

The ActiLife Data Vault takes advantage of a technology known as
multipart uploads. This technique delineates the files into multiple
parts and uploads each part to the Data Vault. This technique results in
much faster uploads over slow connections and increases reliability,
since failed uploads can be restarted where they left off. For this
reason, the Data Vault tool is superior to other methods of file sharing
such as FTP, email, and network sharing.

VIEWING UPLOAD PROGRESS
-----------------------

To view the upload progress for the queued files, click on the hyperlink
below the progress indicator. This will open the Data Vault Transfers
window. From there, file transfers can be cancelled and status
information can be viewed.
