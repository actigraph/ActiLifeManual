Licensing
---------

ActiLife software is a licensed program and requires users to obtain a
product key before the software can be activated. If you have not
purchased an ActiLife license, you may do so by visiting the ActiGraph
store at `www.theactigraph.com/store <www.theactigraph.com/store>`__. If
you have misplaced your product key, contact ActiGraph sales support at
`support@theactigraph.com <support@theactigraph.com>`__ in order to
proceed. Once ActiLife 6 has been purchased or upgraded from a previous
version, users are entitled to free updates for 12 months. After that
period, an optional maintenance plan may be purchased. **It is highly
recommended that users purchase the maintenance plan in order to
guarantee access to the newest updates, features, and bug fixes.**   ##
ACTIVATION OVER THE INTERNET ## The first time the program is launched,
users will be presented with a screen similar to that shown in Figure 3.
If you have already received a product key for your ActiLife Pro or
ActiLife Lite software, type that product key in the box provided. If
the license formatting is correct, a green check mark will appear to the
right of the license box. Click “Activate”. ActiLife will connect to
ActiGraph’s license server to confirm that the product key is correct
and that it has indeed been purchased or upgraded. After activation, a
screen similar to the one shown in Figure 4 will be displayed. This
screen summarizes the product type and the number of activations used
and available, as well as the name and contact information of the person
to whom the license is registered. **Name, Email, and Organization
fields must be populated in order to continue**. This activation process
is required for each computer on which ActiLife is running.

ActiLife product key in the first box that appears after launching the
program. After clicking “Continue,” a screen similar to Figure 5 will
appear. Provide the 24-character product key to ActiGraph customer
service representative. After validating the product key, the
